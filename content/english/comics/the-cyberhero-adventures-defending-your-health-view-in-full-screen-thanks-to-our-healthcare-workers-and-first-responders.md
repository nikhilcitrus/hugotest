It's a very unfortunate coincidence that within the cybersecurity Community, words such as "Cyber Hygiene", "Infection" and "Virus", now have a real double meaning. This edition focuses on protecting Personal Health Information (PHI), Digital Medical Device security and other solutions within the healthcare ecosystem. It is dedicated to ALL of the unsung heroes who toil in anonymity to keep us safe at work, home and school. THANK YOU! Gary Berman, Creator.
